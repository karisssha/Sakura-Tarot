## 🌟 Project Objectives

Our goal is to create an application that consumes the Sakura API, which returns a JSON file containing information about the cards. For this project, users will be able to choose 3 cards to read as a horoscope from the Sakura Cards Deck.

Users will select three cards: one for the past, one for the present, and one for the future. After making their selections, they will receive the meaning of each chosen card.
